## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup

- Download or git clone https://github.com/AllanAscencio/instagram_follower_bot
- cd instagram_follower_bot

## Install Selenium:
Use pip to install the selenium package. Python 3 has pip available in the standard library. Using pip, you can install selenium like this:

```
  pip install selenium
```

You may consider using virtualenv to create isolated Python environments. Python 3 has venv which is almost the same as virtualenv.

You can also download Python bindings for Selenium from the [PyPI page for selenium package](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/). and install manually.

If you need further documentation you can head to https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

After Selenium is perfectly installed you should be able to run the code properly.
